# SBOannotator: Automated SBO Term Annotation Tool

SBOannotator is a Python-based tool that automatically assigns Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) terms to entities in SBML models. It dynamically fetches SBO terms from the OLS API, integrates enzymatic data from external sources like BRENDA, and provides intelligent term suggestions using Large Language Models (LLMs). The tool also features a user-friendly web-based GUI built with Flask.

## Features

- **Dynamic SBO Term Fetching**: Fetches SBO terms from the OLS API.
- **Enzymatic Data Integration**: Retrieves enzymatic data from BRENDA.
- **LLM-Based Suggestions**: Uses OpenAI GPT to recommend relevant SBO terms.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Provides an intuitive web interface for users.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for network, API, and file I/O issues.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Git

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Oywon/SBOannotator.git
   cd SBOannotator
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv sboannotator-env
   source sboannotator-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: sboannotator-env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas flask openai
   ```

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface (CLI)
To fetch SBO terms and get LLM-based suggestions, run:
```bash
python fetch_sbo_terms.py
```
Enter a reaction description when prompted (e.g., `glucose + ATP -> glucose-6-phosphate + ADP`).

### Web-Based GUI
To start the Flask-based GUI, run:
```bash
python app.py
```
Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

#### Example Workflow
1. Enter a reaction description in the input field.
2. Click **Get SBO Terms and LLM Suggestions**.
3. View the results:
   - SBO terms are saved to `sbo_terms.json`.
   - LLM suggestions are displayed on the page.
