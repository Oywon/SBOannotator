# SBOannotator: Automated SBO Term Annotation Tool

SBOannotator is a Python-based tool that automatically assigns Systems Biology Ontology (SBO) terms to entities in SBML models. It dynamically fetches SBO terms from the OLS API and integrates enzymatic data from external sources like BRENDA. The tool also provides intelligent term suggestions using Large Language Models (LLMs) and features a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Features

- **Dynamic SBO Term Fetching**: Fetches SBO terms from the OLS API.
- **Enzymatic Data Integration**: Retrieves enzymatic data from BRENDA.
- **LLM-Based Suggestions**: Uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to recommend relevant SBO terms.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Provides an intuitive interface for users.
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for network, API, and file I/O issues.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or later
- Git

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Oywon/SBOannotator.git
   cd SBOannotator
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv sboannotator-env
   source sboannotator-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: sboannotator-env\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install requests pandas flask
   ```

## Usage

### Fetching SBO Terms
To fetch and save SBO terms, run:
```bash
python fetch_sbo_terms.py
```
This will fetch SBO terms from the OLS API and save them to `sbo_terms.json`.

### Fetching Enzymatic Data
To fetch enzymatic data for a specific EC number, run:
```bash
python fetch_brenda_data.py --ec_number 1.1.1.1
```
Replace `1.1.1.1` with the desired EC number.

### Running the GUI
To start the graphical user interface, run:
```bash
python app.py
```
Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.
